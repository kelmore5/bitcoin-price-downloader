# Bitcoin Price Updater

This is a tool to download Bitcoin ticker prices from Kraken Market via its API.

Using the Excel template and the Google script from lib, this tool finds the BTC
ticker using columns C5:C and outputs their current price in D5:D.

The script can be edited to change where the input is retrieved or you can just use
the provided template and add more tickers to the C column.

BTC tickers can be looked up at Kraken Market, [here](https://cryptowatch.de/markets/kraken/btc/usd)

## Install

The easiest way to utilize this project is to make a copy of the Google sheet using this
shareable link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aGEiwC4Xu0AjfJZHydHrtq9XWuXme05gdUNUNnr5Wxw/edit?usp=sharing)

Otherwise, you can download the spreadsheet and script from the lib folder and upload them to your
own Google drive for use.
